# LSTM Time Series Prediction Example

This repository demonstrates a **simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model** using Python and TensorFlow/Keras 
to predict the next value in a time series.

LSTMs are a type of **recurrent neural network (RNN)** designed to handle sequential data. They can "remember" 
patterns over time, making them ideal for tasks like:

- Time series forecasting  
- Anomaly detection  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  

In this example, we use a **sine wave** as a sample dataset to illustrate how an LSTM predicts the next value 
based on previous observations.
